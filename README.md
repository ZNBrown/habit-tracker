Working in a team of five we created an app that will allow users to track the progress of their chosen habits. The app was designed to allow users to record any habits of their choice, set a time limit according to daily/weekly/monthly and set a target of times they need to carry out that habit within the specified time limit. The project brief included the following:

Our web app has the following functionality for users:

* Users are able to login

* Users are able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the     frequency at which they want to track the habit

* Users are able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day

* Users are able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see their most recent completion streak

Our project meets the following technical requirements:

* Data is persisted in a database

* Our app has a minimum 60% test coverage 

* Our codebase primarily features the technologies covered during our time on the course

### Installation & Usage
